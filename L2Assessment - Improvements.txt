L2Assessment - Improvements Summary

1. Improved Urgency Classification
   - We updated the system to rely on the AI's advanced reasoning rather than a simple rule-based calculator.
   - The AI now explicitly determines if a message is High, Medium, or Low urgency.
   - Example: A critical message like "Our production server is down!" is now correctly flagged as High Urgency, whereas previously it might have been stuck at "Medium".

2. "Recommended Message" Feature
   - We added a new feature that generates a draft response for the customer support agent.
   - The analysis results now include a "Suggested Response" box with a Copy button.
   - Tone: The AI was instructed to be warm, empathetic, and assuring—specifically avoiding generic "we'll look into it" phrases.
   - Example: For a delayed refund complaint, the AI generated: "Hi there, I'm so sorry to hear that you're still waiting for your refund... I want to assure you that I'm here to help and I will personally track this until it is resolved."
